## Meshtastic

[MeshtasticÂ®](https://meshtastic.org) is an open-source community project that allows anybody to communicate over LoRa nodes serving as a decentralized  communications platform. Learn more at [Meshtastic Documentation](https://meshtastic.org/docs/overview).

- Long-range communication ([205 mile record MartinR7 & alleg](https://meshtastic.org/docs/overview/range-tests/#current-ground-record-331km))
- Autonomous network with no central oversight
- Free of surveillance, censorship, and control
- Secure encryption

## Iowa Mesh

We are a community of people in Iowa building a resilient, functional, and soverign communications network using various LoRa nodes. Our network does not require any form of license to use, operating within the ISM 915MHz frequency band. LoRa nodes are flashed with the Meshtastic firmware. 

Meshtastic is an open-source application for building local and wide-area mesh networks using inexpensive hardware that will continue to operate even under adverse conditions.

The purpose of Iowa Mesh is to expand coverage in Iowa and build a community-owned and operated network. We have several nodes in Des Moines and Waukee.
